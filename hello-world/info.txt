NEXT JS  pre-renders every page in the application

NEXT JS generates every HTML for each in advance instead of having it all done by client-side Javascript.

Why pre-render?
Pre-rendering refers to the process of generating HTML with the necessary data for a page in our application.


Pre-rendering can result in better performance and SEO.
